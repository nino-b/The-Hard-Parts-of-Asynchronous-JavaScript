# The Hard Parts of Asynchronous JavaScript

# Introduction

Welcome! This repository shows my journey through [Will Sentance's](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/will-sentance/) [The Hard Parts of Asynchronous JavaScript"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/) workshop. This workshop contains course resources, with the code I write along and my notes. The code in this repository is based on [The Hard Parts of Asynchronous JavaScript"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/) workshop.

## About the Workshop

This workshop covers new features of JavaScript in ES6+: iterators, generators, promises, and async/await. How promises are implemented under-the-hood to truly help fix the challenge of inversion of control in asynchronous code design. Plus, use iterators and generators to master asynchronous control flow. Go under the hood and solve complex async challenges by using the call stack, event loop, callback queue, micro-task queue and browser APIs.
